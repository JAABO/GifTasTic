Hello

This is exercise on AJAX and API

Document starts with few animals in the button.

BUTTONS
=============

Button will pull up random 10 GIF's from www.giphy.com using the API key on AJAX call.

All GIF's are on still mode until pressed on it.


FORM:
=============
Also I have a form to fill out and once "submit" button is pressed, form populates additional button with animal name.
    
    If the form is not filled out, it alerts a message "You did not fill the form!".
